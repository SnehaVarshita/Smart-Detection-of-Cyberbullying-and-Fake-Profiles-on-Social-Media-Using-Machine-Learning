Social media is now a big part of daily life, part of which comes with safety challenges such as 
cyberbullying and the increased presence of fake profiles that put user safety and trust at risk. 
This project proposes a web-based system employing machine learning tools to recognize harmful
content and also the users behind such malicious content on social networking sites. The system is
made up of two primary modules: Cyberbullying Detection module is a Natural Language
Processing (NLP) module that analyzes the user-submitted text for abusive language, hate speech,
or harassment and Fake Profile Detection module measures profile attributes like presence of a
profile picture, username type, and the user's bio's content characteristics to provide conclusions of
authenticity. The system uses algorithms like Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Logistic
Regression as classification algorithms. User interface frontend was designed using HTML, CSS
and JavaScript to be responsive, followed database management and user authentication with
SQLite. The final system showcases how machine learning can be used to detect harmful content
and suspicious profiles, offering a proof of concept for improving online awareness and safety
